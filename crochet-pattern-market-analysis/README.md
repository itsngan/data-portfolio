# 🧶 Ravelry Crochet Pattern Market Analysis

This project analyzes trends in crochet pattern listings using [Ravelry API](https://www.ravelry.com/api) 
to understand what factors influence popularity and rating.

## 🌟 Motivation
As a crocheter learn data science, I wanted to analyze real-world data from the crafting community. 
After some attempts at scraping from Etsy, I found Ravelry, which provides a rich dataset of patterns, 
yarns, and creators, making it a perfect source for exploring creative trends through data.
